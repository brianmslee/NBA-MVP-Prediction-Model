# NBA-MVP-Prediction-Model

## NBA MVP Prediction Model for the 2018-2023 NBA seasons. I used a Kaggle dataset for the 2018-2019 NBA season predictions and manually compiled data from basketball-reference.com for the subsequent seasons. The project included a trial and error based TensorFlow neural network model, a hyperparameter tuned neural network model, Scikit-Learn linear regression model, and a random forest regression ensemble learning algorithm. 
## I utilized Keras tuner for the neural network hyperparameter tuning, SelectKBest for the linear regression model's feature selection, and feature importances for the random forest regressor model's feature selection.
